a small guess the number game that I created from a udemy course for JavaScript. In the game there is a random number that is generated and hidden and the player must guess a number between 1 - 20. If the player guesses a number 5 and the hidden number is 10 for example, they will lose a point(points start at 20).
Once they guessed wrong they will be told if the hidden number is higher or lower than the guess they made.
The aim of the game is to guess the correct number in as few attempts as possible.
